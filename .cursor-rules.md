All development must be executed inside Docker containers.

IMPORTANT: Project Working Directory
- All code changes MUST be made in: `/Users/georgebrown/Projects/PokedexGo`
- This is the project root directory where all source code lives

Do NOT:
- run language runtimes on the host
- install dependencies on the host
- assume host PHP/Node/Python availability
- make changes outside of `/Users/georgebrown/Projects/PokedexGo`

All commands must be written using:
- docker compose exec
- docker compose run
- docker build / docker compose up

If a task requires a command, it must be a Docker-based command.

IMPORTANT: After Making Code Changes
The project runs in PRODUCTION mode with code baked into Docker images (no volume mounts).
After ANY code changes, you MUST rebuild and restart Docker containers:

```bash
cd /Users/georgebrown/Projects/PokedexGo
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

To rebuild only specific services:
```bash
docker compose build api    # Rebuild API only
docker compose build web    # Rebuild Web only
docker compose up -d        # Restart services
```

This ensures code changes are reflected in running containers.
